## Usage Examples

### Basic Agent Creation and Monitoring
```cpp

// Get global introspector
auto& introspector = Kokkos::Tools::Experimental::getGlobalIntrospector();

// Register a monitoring agent
uint32_t agent_id = introspector.registerAgent("MyExecutionContext");
auto* agent = introspector.getAgent(agent_id);

// Record resource usage
agent->recordKernelExecution(kernel_id, execution_time);
agent->recordMemoryUsage(memory_bytes);
agent->recordParallelRegion(thread_count);

// Perform self-assessment
double performance_score = agent->performSelfAssessment();
```

### System-Wide Optimization
```cpp
// Aggregate all agent states
auto aggregated_metrics = introspector.aggregateAgentStates();

// Generate system optimization recommendations
auto system_feedback = introspector.generateSystemOptimization();

// Apply adaptive feedback to all agents
introspector.applyAdaptiveFeedback();

// Calculate overall system efficiency
double efficiency = introspector.calculateSystemEfficiency();
```

### Recursive Assessment
```cpp
// Perform comprehensive recursive assessment
introspector.recursiveSystemAssessment();

// Trigger global introspection
introspector.performGlobalIntrospection();

// Access global feedback
const auto& feedback = introspector.getGlobalFeedback();
```
