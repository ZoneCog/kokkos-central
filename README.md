# Kokkos EcoSystem

The Kokkos C++ Performance Portability EcoSystem is a production level solution for writing modern C++ applications in a hardware agnostic way.
Its development is supported by the US Department of Energies Exascale Project â€“ the leading effort in the US to prepare the HPC community for the next generation of super computing platforms.
The EcoSystem consists of multiple libraries addressing the primary concerns for developing and maintaining applications in a portable way.
The three main components are the Kokkos Core Programming Model, the Kokkos Kernels Math Libraries and the Kokkos Profiling and Debugging Tools.
