# Agentic Kernel Framework for Kokkos-Central

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of an agentic kernel framework that encodes all repository modules as agentic kernels with explicit tensor shapes, following hypergraph pattern encoding. Each kernel is implemented as a Scheme-style dictionary, with tensor shapes determined by degrees of freedom and computational depth, optimized for cognitive synergy and future GGML customization.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **TensorShape** (`kernel_dict.py`)
   - Explicit tensor dimension tracking
   - Support for sparse patterns via sparsity matrices
   - Degrees of freedom calculation
   - Memory layout optimization (ROW_MAJOR, COL_MAJOR, SPARSE_CSR, etc.)

2. **HypergraphPattern** (`kernel_dict.py`)
   - Multi-way connectivity representation using hypergraph theory
   - Cognitive affinity calculation for synergy optimization
   - Edge weighting for importance ranking

3. **AgenticKernel** (`kernel_dict.py`)
   - Main kernel representation as Scheme-style dictionary
   - Input/output tensor management
   - Computational depth tracking
   - Memory requirement estimation
   - GGML compatibility flags

4. **KernelFactory** (`kernel_factory.py`)
   - Automatic extraction of kernels from existing code
   - Support for Python, C++, and MLIR analysis
   - Pattern recognition for parallel operations
   - Tensor shape inference from code context

5. **CognitiveOptimizer** (`cognitive_optimizer.py`)
   - Cognitive synergy optimization algorithms
   - Connectivity, complexity, efficiency, and adaptability metrics
   - Inter-kernel optimization for collections
   - Pattern recognition and adaptation

6. **GGMLAdapter** (`ggml_compatibility.py`)
   - Conversion to GGML-compatible representations
   - C code generation for GGML integration
   - Compatibility validation and optimization
   - JSON export for external tools

## Key Features

### Explicit Tensor Shapes

All tensors are represented with explicit shapes that include:
- Dimension tuples with support for dynamic dimensions (-1)
- Memory layout specifications (row-major, column-major, sparse formats)
- Sparsity patterns using NumPy arrays
- Degrees of freedom calculation based on actual data elements

### Hypergraph Pattern Encoding

Computational dependencies are encoded as hypergraphs:
- Vertices represent kernel components and tensors
- Hyperedges capture multi-way dependencies
- Edge weights indicate connection importance
- Cognitive affinity metrics measure synergy potential

### Scheme-Style Dictionary Representation

Each kernel can be serialized as a Scheme-style dictionary with rich metadata for cognitive synergy and GGML compatibility.

### Cognitive Synergy Optimization

The framework includes sophisticated optimization algorithms:
1. **Connectivity Score**: Measures hypergraph connectivity density
2. **Complexity Score**: Evaluates computational and memory complexity
3. **Efficiency Score**: Assesses memory usage and parallelism effectiveness
4. **Adaptability Score**: Measures flexibility for different scenarios
5. **Synergy Score**: Weighted combination optimizing overall performance

### GGML Compatibility

Built-in support for GGML integration:
- Automatic conversion to GGML tensor specifications
- C code generation for direct GGML usage
- Compatibility validation and optimization
- Support for quantization and memory type selection
