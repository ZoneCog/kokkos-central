# Kokkos EcoSystem

The Kokkos C++ Performance Portability Ecosystem is a solution for writing
modern science and engineering applications in a hardware agnostic way.
It aims to enable its users to write single source software that can then be compiled
for any hardware architecture relevant in compute intensive workload environments.

The Kokkos Project is part of the nonprofit [Linux Foundation](https://linuxfoundation.org).
